# ETAS with covariates

ETAS model implementation based on INLA with productivity parameter depending on covariates.

We only provides three options: the productivity is function of the depth, or the strike of the nearest fault, or both.

The function fitting the model is called ETAS.fit.cov and can be found in utils/code_for_etas_cov.R
